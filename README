Allows only whitelisted tags and attributes through.

The setting ALLOWED_TAGS can override the behavior. The syntax of
this setting is a space-separated list of tags, which are optionally
followed by a colon and a comma-separated list of attribute permitted in
the tag.

For example, to allow <a> tags which are links or named anchors, but not
to allow definition of an onclick attribute:

    ALLOWED_TAGS = "a:href,name"

Disallowed tags or attributes are simply removed.
